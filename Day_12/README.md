# Regular Expression
<p>A regular expression or RegExp is a small programming language that helps to find pattern in data.</p>

## RegExp Parameters
<p>A regular expression takes two parameters. One required search pattern and an optional flag</p>

### Pattern
<p>A pattern could be a text or any form of pattern which have similarities. For instance the word spam in an email could be a pattern we are interested to look for in an email or a phone number format number might be our interest to look for</p>

### Flags
<p>Flags are optional parameters in regular expression which determines the type of searching. Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>g: a global flag which means looking for a pattern in whole text</li>
  <li>i: case insensitive flag(it searches for both lowercase and uppercase)</li>
  <li>m: multiline</li>
</ul>
