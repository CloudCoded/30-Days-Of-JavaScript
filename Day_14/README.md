# Error Handlings And Types
<p>JavaScript is a loosely-typed language. Some times you will get a runtime error when you try to access an undefined variable or call undefined function etc <br/> 

JavaScript similar to python or Java provides an error-handling mechanism to catch runtime errors using try-catch-finally block.</p>

     try {
       // code that may throw an error
     } catch (err) {
        // code to be executed if an error occurs
     } finally {
        // code to be executed regardless of an error occurs or not
     }
