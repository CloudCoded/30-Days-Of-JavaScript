# FUNCTION
<p>A function is a reusable block of code or programming statements designed to perform a particular task. A function is declared by a function keyword followed by a name, followed by parenthesis(). A parenthesis can take a parameter and if so, it will be called with argument. A function can also take a default parameter. To store a data to a function, a function has to return certain data types. To get the value, we call or invoke a function.
