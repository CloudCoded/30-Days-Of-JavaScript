Question 1: Modify the userIdGenerator function. Declare a function name userIdGeneratedByUser. It doesnâ€™t take any parameter but it takes two inputs using prompt(). One of the input is the number of characters and the second input is the number of ids which are supposed to be generated.

The string is converted to base 36 using the .toString(36) method and it must be noted that to use base 36 is not compulsory,you can use base 16 or higher base depending on the specific requirement of the application, and then the first two characters are removed using the .substring(2) method to ensure that the string starts with an alphabetic character.
