ISSUES AND RESOLVE
The first issue I encounter is git conflict, I couldn't push my code because they were two repos with same URL.

HOW IT WAS RESOLVED?
After several attempts, I was able to solve the conflict these following commands:
git remote -v - This command was used to view the URLs of the remote repo.
git remote rm - This command was used to remove the repo URLs 
And then a new repo was created and push again with git push origin HEAD
