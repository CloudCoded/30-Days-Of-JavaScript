What I Learn On The 12th-Feb-2023

Data Types: Primitive and Non-primitive Data Types

Primitive Data Types are: immutable
Number
String
Boolean
Undefined
Null
Symbol

Non-Primitives are: Mutable
Array
Object


Number: Numbers are integers and decimal values which can do arithmetic operations(Math Object: In js, the math object provides lots of methods to work with  numbers e.g math.random, math.floor, math.min, math.ceil, math.max, math.log, math.pow, math.sqrt etc.)


Strings: Strings are text, which are under single, double, or backticks(interpolate str). Str concatenate means connecting or joining of two or more strings together and this is done in different ways. A string could be single char or a paragraph or page(long literal string) or we use backticks(template string => ${})

Escape Sequences in Strings: In JS, \ followed by some characters is an escape sequence. for example:

\n: new line
\t: Tab, means 8 spaces
\\: Back slash
\': Single quote (')
\": Double quote (")

What I also learn today are:

String methods
Checking data types and casting(changing).
