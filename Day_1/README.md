What I Learn On The 8th-Feb-2023

i. INTRODUCTION TO JAVASCRIPT

JavaScript was initially created to "make web pages alive". JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive (e.g., having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.). There are also more advanced server side versions of JavaScript such as Node.js, which allow you to add more functionality to a website than downloading files (such as realtime collaboration between multiple computers).

    iii. Console.log() function

    To write our first JavaScript code, we used a built-in function console.log(). We passed an argument as input data, and the function displays the output. 

    The console.log() function can take multiple parameters separated by commas. The syntax looks like as follows:console.log(param1, param2, param3)

    iv. Comments in javascript

    We can add comments to our code. Comments are very important to make code more readable and to leave remarks in our code. JavaScript does not execute the comment part of our code. In JavaScript, any text line starting with // in JavaScript is a comment, and anything enclosed like this // is also a comment.

    v. Ways of adding javascript to the webpage:
     - INLINE SCRIPT => An inline script is a script that is not loaded from an external file, but embedded inside HTML. A script tag without a src (ie. with code directly in the HTML document) is referred to as an inline script. 

     - INTERNAL SCRIPT => The internal script can be written in the head or the body, but it is preferred to put it on the body of the HTML document.

     - External Script => 
     - Multi-External Script

ii. Variables
 
iii. Data Types in Javascript
